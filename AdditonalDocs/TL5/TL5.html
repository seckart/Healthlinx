<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Example  One:  Infusion Pump Tubing – Unplanned  Change</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital (TCH) has been using  Alaris IV infusion pumps for large volume infusions for over 7 years. Until  July of 2016, Medfusion syringe pumps were used in addition to the Alaris pumps  in order to administer medications that were supplied by the pharmacy  department in syringes.  Syringe drug  delivery allows for more accurate administration, especially important in the  management of very small neonates and critically ill children. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decision was made to convert entirely to  the Alaris system including the Alaris syringe pump. The need to eliminate the  Medfusion syringe pump included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access  to a larger drug library</li>
  <li>Capability  of initiating drug library updates wirelessly through CareFusion</li>
  <li>Standardization  of tubing with single vendor support</li>
  <li>Ability  to conduct closed-loop medication administration with CareFusion pumps and EPIC  prospectively </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TCH chose to adopt the Alaris syringe pump  module and its associated disposables including the syringe pump tubing with a  pressure sensing disc and closed medication system <a href="../Evidence/TL5a-1.pdf">(Evidence  TL5a-1, CareFusion PCA and Syringe Project Steering Team Meeting Notes)</a>.  The syringe pump tubing with a  pressure-sensing disc enables the pump to begin the infusion quicker, and it  allows the nurse to detect and act on occlusions more readily when compared to  other syringe pumps in the market.  The  closed medication system decreases the amount of access to the IV line, thereby  decreasing the likelihood of contamination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The syringe pump module and tubing was  officially implemented in the Main Campus and West Campus on July 26,  2016.  The tubing with the pressure  sensing disc was to be used for continuous infusions of critical medications  like vasopressors, prostaglandins, inotropes, sedatives, analgesics, and  insulin.  Patient care areas with a high  volume of intermittent medications were to use the closed medication system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few weeks after go-live, TCH clinical  nurses and nurse leaders identified an increase in reports of leaking and  defective syringe pump tubing.  On August  15, 2016, nurse leader, Tarra Kerr, MSN, RN, NEA-BC, Director of Nursing,  Cardiac Critical Care, convened a workgroup of nurse leaders, clinical nurses,  physicians, and representatives from the Patient Safety and Quality  Departments, Supply Chain Management, Clinical Informatics, and CareFusion to evaluate  the reported issue and identify potential solutions to these unplanned chain of  events.</p>

<p align="center">TL5a, CareFusion  Product Issues Meeting Workgroup</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kerr facilitated the collaboration between  the CareFusion  Product Issues Meeting Workgroup  members to develop the following plan to respond immediately to the concerns: <a href="../Evidence/TL5a-2.pdf">(Evidence TL5a-2, CareFusion Product Issues Meeting Workgroup  and Safety Scoop Events)</a>: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Collect all defective product for CareFusion</li>
  <li>Obtain investigative reports from CareFusion  for all defective product</li>
  <li>Identify affected lot numbers currently used  at TCH, and investigate potential replacement products</li>
  <li>Develop a communication plan to nursing  regarding issue and solutions</li>
  <li>Establish a daily status update</li>
  <li>Clinical  specialists to conduct clinical inquiries using ListServ to evaluate if other children&rsquo;s  hospitals were experiencing issues with the CareFusion product </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this critical time of unplanned change, leadership was provided  by Kerr as events unfolded on almost a daily basis. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On August 17, 2016, Kerr guided the nurses  through the unplanned change by communicating the first Safety Alert and Resolution Plan to the Nursing Director teams  for distribution to their clinical staff <a href="../Evidence/TL5a-3.pdf">(Evidence TL5a-3, Safety Alert  Communication Email)</a>.  The  action plan involved the replacement of the entire stock of pressure sensing  disc tubing with specific lot numbers across the health system. These lot  numbers were suspected to be defective. Tubing infusing critical drips that  could not be replaced without compromising patient safety would be clearly  labeled with a sticker, in order to identify that the product came from  suspected defective lot number. At this time, plans to replace the closed  medication system were on hold pending replacement product availability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the night shift of August 17, 2016, a  serious safety event occurred on a patient on critical drips infusing through  the pressure sensing disc tubing from a suspected defective lot. Kerr convened  the workgroup the  next morning and revised the  original action plan. The revised action plan was to replace all pressure  sensing disc tubing from the suspected defective lot with new product. Kerr  communicated the revised plan to  clinical nurses through the Nursing Director group <a href="../Evidence/TL5a-4.pdf">(Evidence TL5a-4, Smart Pump Tubing Issues Evaluation  Session Meeting Notes, Safety Scoop Event, Safety Alert Communication Email)</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite  these efforts, safety events related to the pressure sensing disc tubing and  the closed medication system continued to occur. Kerr guided the workgroup to  the next unplanned change. A decision to cease the use of the pressure sensing  disc for all critical infusions. Clinical nurses and other nurse leaders were  charged to communicate the  change to their areas and to facilitate the transition. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognizing the criticality of keeping nurse  leaders and clinical nurses up to date and aware of the functionality of the  pumps and tubing options, Kerr instituted meetings between TCH senior leadership and CareFusion  executives. In the meetings Kerr provided information about the CareFusion  product issues, assured support, and advocated to host a CareFusion engineer on-site at TCH.  Kerr&rsquo;s objective was for the clinical staff and vendor to work  together to understand the pump&rsquo;s functionality, and to determine the best  tubing solution that would not compromise patient safety. On August 22,  2016, after a full day of  collaborating, testing, and brainstorming, the CareFusion Product Issues  Meeting Workgroup made the recommendation  to discontinue the use of the pressure sensing disc tubing system wide, and to  replace the current stock of closed medication systems. Kerr and the workgroup  reviewed these recommendations to ensure safety and efficacy of drug  administration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On August 25, 2016, Kerr facilitated huddles  with clinical nurses, educators, and nurse leaders to guide them through the  following immediate changes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>All Closed Medication Systems in-stock at TCH  will be replaced with an alternate, similar product</li>
  <li>Pressure Sensing Disc tubing will be eliminated  from TCH.  All continuous infusions will  need to be infused through a straight line tubing with no pressure sensing  disc.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  her continued efforts to support nurses through this unplanned change, Kerr  followed-up the huddle with an email to the Nursing Directors and clinical  nurses to assist them and their teams. In ten days, Kerr led TCH clinical  nurses through unplanned change of equipment failure with the hospital&rsquo;s IV tubing supply. Kerr guided  clinical nurses and nurse leaders to identify issues with products and  processes, develop safe and practical solutions, and communicate the changes  with others in the organization.  After  the final changes were implemented August 26, 2016, safety events related to the replacement products  decreased significantly and no trends of equipment  failure were identified. <a href="../Evidence/TL5a-5.pdf">(Evidence TL5a-5, CareFusion  Huddle Meeting Notes, Safety Alert Email and Attachments, CareFusion Tubing  Update Attendance, CareFusion Tubing Issues Report)</a>. The discussions between  Kerr, TCH senior leadership and CareFusion executives, actions initiated by the  CareFusion Product Issues Meeting Workgroup, and the utilization of this IV  tubing product at many healthcare organizations, led to a national alert.  </p>
