<p><span class="additional_docs_TCH">Nurse leaders per ANCC definition include Nursing Directors, Asst.  Vice Presidents, and Vice Presidents of Nursing at Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  Positons that do not fall under ANCC nurse  leader definition, but are addressed here to encompass &ldquo;all levels&rdquo; are PCMs,  ACDs, Nurse Educators, CNS, and APPs, and will <u>not</u> be found on the  leadership table under nurse leader. Please see below revised description to  clarify all tools utilized by all levels</span>.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nurses at  all levels at Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital (TCH) complete a self-appraisal tool, a  peer feedback tool, and a performance review tool annually.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TCH  utilizes the organization-wide policy to guide the procedures related to the  self-appraisal and performance review tool process (Evidence OO10-1, Performance Management Policy).  The tool consists of objectives, success profiles, and development plan. The  functionality of the electronic document does not allow printing of blank tools  for some steps of the performance evaluation process; blinded, completed tools  have therefore been submitted in some instances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peer  feedback tools are completed per Nursing Department guidelines.  The appropriate peer feedback tool is  selected in the electronic system depending on the nurse&rsquo;s role.  The individual selects 2-3 nursing peers to  receive the role specific peer feedback from.   The supervisor is able to select 2-3 additional nursing peers (dependent  on the department size).  After feedback  is completed, the employee receives a summary of numeric scores and verbatim  comments.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is  a description of each review process:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clinical  Nurses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clinical nurses&rsquo;  self-appraisal, peer feedback tool, and performance review tools are submitted  annually.</li>
  <li>There is an in-patient  and ambulatory template for clinical nurses to select, depending on the nurses&rsquo;  clinical area.</li>
  <li>Clinical nurses from  all settings utilize the same peer feedback tool (regardless of location).</li>
  <ul>
    <li>(Evidence OO10-2, Inpatient Clinical Nurse  Self-Appraisal Tool)  </li>
    <li>(Evidence OO10-3, Inpatient Clinical Nurse Performance  Review Tool) </li>
    <li>(Evidence OO10-4, Ambulatory Clinical Nurse  Self-Appraisal Tool)</li>
    <li>(Evidence OO10-5, Ambulatory Clinical Nurse Performance  Review Tool)</li>

  </ul>
</ul>

  <li>Nurse Practitioners and  Clinical Nurse Specialists both fall within this category, and each have  templates to complete the self-appraisal, peer feedback tool, and performance  review tools, depending on their role.</li>
  <li>Nurse Practitioners use  the Focused Professional Practice Evaluation (FPPE) and Ongoing Professional  Practice Evaluation (OPPE) form which serves as their peer feedback tool.  This tool is filled out every 6 months by a  selection of 2-3 peers. </li>
  <li>Clinical Nurse  Specialists have a peer feedback tool, completed by nursing peers annually.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>(Evidence OO10-7, Advanced Practice Provider  Self-Appraisal Tool) </li>

<ul>
  <li>Nurse educators&rsquo; self-appraisal,  peer feedback tool, and performance review tools are submitted annually.  </li>

  <li>Ambulatory  nurse educators have centralized objectives and success profiles that align  with the nursing strategic plan. The tool is individualized to meet the  specific quality, safety, and operational goals in the Ambulatory setting.</li>
  <li>All nurse educators  utilize the same peer feedback tool.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>(Evidence OO10-13, Inpatient Education Coordinator  Self-Appraisal Tool) </li>
    <li>(Evidence OO10-14, Inpatient Education Coordinator  Performance Review Tool)</li>

In addition, the  CNO is able to incorporate aspects of her strategic plan in the performance  review to assure the nursing executives are aligned and making progress on the  strategic initiatives for nursing.  Asst.  Vice Presidents and Vice Presidents of Nursing self-appraisal and performance  review tools are contained in the same document.  The Asst. Vice Presidents and Vice Presidents  of Nursing fill out the &ldquo;areas of strength&rdquo; and &ldquo;opportunities for development&rdquo;  columns as a  method of self-appraisal.  Next, their  supervisor validates these two columns as a performance review.  Finally, the Asst. Vice Presidents and Vice  Presidents of Nursing and their supervisor work collaboratively to develop  items to complete the &ldquo;action items&rdquo; column. </li>
  <li>The Directors of  Nursing, Asst. Vice President, and Vice Presidents of Nursing utilize the same  Nurse Leader Peer Feedback tool.  Each  role identifies nursing peers at their level within the organization to receive  feedback from.  </li>
