<h3>Improving Patient Safety by  Nurses Addressing The Joint Commission&rsquo;s 2012 National Patient Safety Goal  (07.06.01) leading to a Reduction in Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract  Infection Rates (CAUTI) for Pediatric Inpatients</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  In 2012, Texas  Children&rsquo;s Hospital (TCH) joined the Solutions for Patient Safety Group (SPS),  a network including 80+ children&rsquo;s hospitals nationwide, who partner to develop  and implement effective prevention standards while creating a high reliability  culture and partnering with patients and families, network hospitals are  working to achieve specific goals. The SPS network supports participating  hospitals on their journey toward zero harm by providing frequent training and  learning opportunities,&nbsp;tools, data collection and analysis, opportunities  to collaborate, and much more.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When TCH  joined the SPS, there were several areas of focus including CAUTI. TCH formed  the Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection Cohort to focus on the  prevention of CAUTI.  The group consisted  of nursing, physicians, and infection control from the areas of the hospital  with the highest indwelling urinary catheters.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2012, The  Joint Commission (JC) released a National Patient Safety Goal (NPSG) to Prevent  CAUTI:</p>
<p>NPSG-Prevent  CAUTI</p>
<p><br>
  NPSG.07.06.01-  Prevent indwelling Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infections:<br>
  Manage indwelling  urinary catheters according to established evidence-based guidelines that  address the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Secure  catheters for unobstructed urine flow and drainage</li>
  <li>Maintain  sterility of the urine collection system</li>
  <li>Replace  the urine collection system when required</li>
  <li>Collect  urine samples with aseptic technique</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  alignment with The Joint Commission 2012 NPSG Prevent CAUTI, in September 2012,  the Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection Cohort implemented the CAUTI  Bundle which included the following elements: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Necessity  of the catheter</li>
  <li>Pericare  performed and documented at least once per shift </li>
  <li>Drainage  bag maintained below the bladder</li>
  <li>Maintain  less than 1,000 mL in the collection bag at one time </li>
  <li>Catheter  securement </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These bundle  elements were developed from evidence based practice based on recommendations  from Solutions for Patient Safety Group as well as the NPSG from The Joint Commission. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  October 2013, the TCH CAUTI Cohort identified key drivers and interventions  that pertained to the high-risk bundle elements of pericare and securement.  A securement device was chosen and videos  were made to reinforce proper insertion and care techniques. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015,  The Joint Commission released additional elements for NPSG.07.06.01 which  states: &ldquo;Monitor compliance with evidenced based guidelines or best practices&rdquo;,  referring to  using guidelines for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract  infections (CAUTI). In August 2016, the Pediatric inpatient CAUTI rate  increased from 0.5 CAUTIs/1,000 device days to 1.92 CAUTIs/1,000 device days. The  TCH CAUTI cohort examined this goal and reexamined the Cohort focus on the  individual bundle elements and increasing compliance with the bundle.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal Statement</strong><br>
  Decrease  the Pediatric Inpatient CAUTI rate. The rate is calculated by the number of  CAUTIs per month divided by the sum of the number of days indwelling catheters  are in place per month multiplied by 1,000.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description of the  Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  The  intervention period was September 2016 through February 2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>September 2016 </strong><br>
  In  September 2016, the TCH CAUTI Cohort identified commonalities among the  infections.  Many of the infections  related back to long periods of time that catheters were in place. The TCH  CAUTI Cohort assessed current practices and determined the duration of the  catheter was not being successfully addressed as well as pericare consistently  being performed every shift.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Catheter Removal Best Practice Alert  </em><br>
  The TCH CAUTI  Cohort examined their key driver diagram to identify which of the bundle elements  had not yet been addressed. According to the CAUTI bundle, which is based on  the NPSG and SPS elements, the catheter is to be reviewed for necessity daily. Current  practice at TCH was that the necessity of the catheter was documented by clinical  nurses every shift.  The nurses felt that  the ownership should fall with the provider. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TCH CAUTI  Cohort identified that the provider should decide if the catheter needed to remain  in place and developed a best practice alert in conjunction with several clinical  nurses.  The best practice alert pops up  when the provider logs into the patient&rsquo;s electronic medical record when the  catheter has been in place for three days (72 hours). This timeframe is based  on evidence-based practice that infection risk tends to increase significantly  past this timeframe. The best practice alert asks the provider if they would  like the patient to continue to have the catheter in place or if they would  like to discontinue it. If they choose discontinue, it navigates the provider  to the order for discontinuation. If they would like to continue with the  catheter, it prompts the provider to choose a reason for continuation. The best  practice alert will then pop up again at a certain time interval based upon the  reason given.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education  was provided to providers and clinical nurses through shared governance  councils, staff meetings, and physician meetings. An email was disseminated to  reinforce the best practice alert. At the end of September 2016, the best  practice alert was implemented organization-wide.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Worklist  </em><br>
  The TCH CAUTI  Cohort determined that a reminder for pericare for clinical nurses would  increase compliance with the evidence based bundle element as this is the  nursing responsibility. A worklist in the electronic medical record was  developed by the TCH CAUTI Cohort for clinical nurses to utilize as a checklist/reminder  when documenting items related to hospital-acquired conditions. The worklist  was vetted through several staff nurse groups seeking feedback and  revisions.  This list is linked to  certain flowsheet rows in the electronic medical record. The pericare item is triggered  by the catheter being added as a line or tube for the patient. The clinical  nurse can either document from the list or flowsheet to have the item removed  from their worklist and it renews every 12 hours for the next shift.  A resurgence of the project with more user-friendly  features and relaunch for all areas following targeted education occurred at  the end of September 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>October 2016 - February 2017</strong><br>
  <em>Bag Placement Education </em><br>
  In  October 2016, the TCH CAUTI Cohort evaluated the placement of the urinary  catheter bag below the bladder with the evidence based bundle element. The goal  was to prevent kinks in the catheter and drainage tubing as well as prevention  of reflux of urine back into the bladder.   The TCH CAUTI Cohort developed an educational flyer with pictures and  captions depicting steps for proper placement of the bag.  In November 2016, the education was presented  at shared governance councils, staff meetings, and disseminated through emails. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>House-Wide Audits</em><br>
  In  December 2016, the TCH CAUTI Cohort met with nurse leaders to determine the  best method for data collection related to the new practices implemented to  improve bundle compliance. For monitoring bundle compliance, the TCH CAUTI Cohort  and nurse leaders decided house-wide data collection was warranted. Bundle  compliance monitoring began in January 2017.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Family Education</em><br>
  In  February 2017, the TCH CAUTI Cohort recognized the lack of family involvement  as well as family education in prevention of CAUTI. The TCH CAUTI Cohort discovered  that Bard Medical urinary catheter distributor for Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital provides  patient/family educational materials in English and Spanish. The TCH CAUTI Cohort  approved the urinary catheter education content, in collaboration with the  Urology department and Patient and Family Services reviewed the educational  materials for content and language level. The patient/family education was  presented in unit staff meetings and discussed with families when urinary  catheters are ordered. Flyers were distributed to clinical nurses as reminders  for patient/family education. The patient/family urinary catheter education was  uploaded to the electronic patient education site.  </p>
