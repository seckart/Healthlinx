<h3>Example One: Onboarding and  Orientation Program for Nurses Transferring within the Organization from the  Inpatient Setting to Ambulatory Services  </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oluwakemi  Orogbemi, MSN, RN Ed.S, Decentralized Education Coordinator for Ambulatory  Services, identified an opportunity to streamline and improve the orientation  program to improve nurses&rsquo; transition into Ambulatory Services from another  specialty care area within Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital (TCH). To enhance the  orientation program, Orogbemi used the knowledge gained from her previous years  of experience as an educator responsible for onboarding new and experienced  nurses, and her own orientation experience at TCH in February 2015.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Orientation Program</strong><br>
  The Ambulatory  Services orientation program previously was a two-day class that was not mandatory,  which consisted of content similar to that provided in hospital-wide  orientation for all employees. Orogbemi recognized that this two-day  orientation program contained no specific information about Ambulatory  Services, various specialties, or similarities to and differences from work in  the inpatient environment. Based on nurses&rsquo; evaluation of the orientation  program and feedback from Ambulatory Services decentralized education coordinators,  in April 2015 Orogbemi discussed the opportunities for improvement with her  leader, Umber Dickerson, MPH, Assistant Director of Business Operation and  Strategic Planning in Ambulatory Services, and Dianne Scardino, FACHE, Vice  President of Ambulatory Services.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May  2015, Orogbemi presented to the Ambulatory Services leadership team the need to  enhance the program to effectively transition nurses into the Ambulatory  Services environment. The Ambulatory Services leadership team supported Orogbemi  and approved her to work in collaboration with the decentralized education coordinators  to enhance the program by implementing changes to its structure and process. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-1.pdf">(Evidence SE7-1, Ambulatory Leadership Team Meeting  Attendance Sheet and Agenda, May 2015) </a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Process: Transition to Onboarding Program</strong><br>
  In June  2015, the Ambulatory Services leadership team approved the new structure and  process of the orientation program. The changes that were implemented to the  Ambulatory Services orientation program in July 2015 included the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implementation of a  welcome email distributed to all nurses transitioning to Ambulatory Services. </li>
  <li>Increased RN engagement  in orientation through the use of outpatient-specific videos and content, with  key personnel included in the orientation process, outlining specific roles and  responsibilities </li>
  <li>Revised communication,  feedback and evaluation tools used to assess the orientation program, and  completion of role-specific criterion checklists and pathways</li>
  <li>Updated materials and  resources provided in the orientation classes</li>
  <li>Established leader  representation in orientation classes</li>
  <li>Inclusion of skills  components and practical training </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reorganization  of the orientation structure and process led to a shift from classroom-style  orientation to a comprehensive program in which the classroom orientation is  only one component of an employee&rsquo;s onboarding experience. The enhanced Ambulatory  Services Orientation and Onboarding Program has created a meaningful experience  for nurses who have transitioned to Ambulatory Services.  Orogbemi, along with the decentralized  education coordinators in Ambulatory Services:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developed an onboarding  and orientation cascade of responsibilities, which was distributed to  Ambulatory leaders through a SharePoint site, providing specific details of the  new employee onboarding process, roles and cascading responsibilities <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-2.pdf">(Evidence SE7-2, Cascading List of Responsibilities)</a>  </li>
  <li>Established packets  that included a &ldquo;welcome new staff&rdquo; document, clinical nurse job description,  orientation pathway, seek and find template, objectives, contact information  for decentralized education coordinators , guidelines and an Ambulatory  Services directory </li>
  <li>Instituted an orientation  schedule based on role and department </li>
  <li>Distributed an orientation  evaluation form to all nurses to obtain feedback</li>
  <li>Updated and revamped  orientation presentations and materials to stay relevant through growth and  change <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-3.pdf">(Evidence SE7-3, Orientation Packet, Program Evaluation  Form)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of the Orientation Program</strong><br>
  From July  2015 to August 2016, 27 nurses transferred to Ambulatory Services and  successfully completed the orientation program. Nurses complete a confidential  evaluation after each orientation program, and positive feedback has been  received about their effective transition into practice and the Ambulatory Services  environment. The 22 nurses who successfully completed the orientation program, are  still working in Ambulatory Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">In June of 2017, a survey was created to  measure the success of the onboarding and orientation program for Registered  Nurses transferring from another specialty care area within Texas Children&rsquo;s  Hospital (TCH).  An email with an  electronic link to a survey was forwarded to the Registered Nurses that  transferred from another specialty care area within TCH from July 2015 to  August 2016. There were 22 recipients that were sent the email with 12  respondents, yielding a response rate of 55%. <a href="../Evidence/SE7c-a.pdf">(Evidence  SE7c-a, Ambulatory Evaluation Survey Results)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><img src="Images/graph1.png" width="760"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">On July 3, 2017, the results were  reviewed by Denise Tanner-Brown RN, BSN, MHA, CPON, Clinical Director of  Nursing, Caner and Hematology Center, Oluwakemi Orogbemi, MSN, RN Ed.S,  Decentralized Education Coordinator for Ambulatory Services, and Umber  Dickerson, MPH, Assistant Director of Business Operation and Strategic Planning  in Ambulatory Services.  Based on the  survey results, Orogbemi in collaboration with Tanner-Brown and Dickerson, developed  a proposed action plan with specific focus on the following three elements: </p>
<ul>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Overall outpatient orientation</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Readiness to function in new role</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Preceptor support</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">On August 4, 2017, at the Ambulatory  Leadership Workshop, Orogbemi presented the results to the Ambulatory Services  leaders to evaluate and discuss the responses of the survey, and  recommendations for the proposed action plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">The study results revealed that  overall, the majority of respondents 64% (n=7) were ready to function in their  new role post orientation, there were 27% (n=3) that felt neutral, and 9% (n=1)  strongly disagreed. There was agreement among the Ambulatory Services leaders  to modify the orientation curriculum specific to transfer employees and  transition requirements, incorporate the organization-wide buddy program into  outpatient orientation structure, and enhance preceptor/coach education and  training. <a href="../Evidence/SE7c-b.pdf">(Evidence  SE7c-b, Ambulatory Leadership Workshop Agenda &amp; Attendance Sheet, Orogbemi  Presentation-Ambulatory Orientation Update, Follow-Up Email &amp; Action Plan) </a></p>

<p><strong>Case Example: Belinda Campbell, RN </strong><br>
  Belinda  Campbell, RN, an experienced clinical nurse, transitioned to the Orthopedic  Surgery Clinic on February 29, 2016 from the inpatient Bone Marrow Transplant  Unit. Brooke Mulkey, BSN, RN, Clinical Program Coordinator in Orthopedic  Surgery, served as her preceptor. Campbell reported directly to LeKeya Weir,  MSN, RN, CPN, Patient Care Manager of Orthopedic Surgery. Campbell&rsquo;s  individualized Universal Interdisciplinary and Role-specific Orientation  Pathways contain action items that address essential job accountabilities,  learning resources, validation criteria and performance validation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The orientation and onboarding  experience began with the receipt of her welcome email and Calendar to  Outpatient Services and the Orthopedic Department. In addition, the Ambulatory  Departmental Orientation Checklist was initiated to provide information on office  space and equipment, access and department-specific rules, policies and  procedures. Basic Life Support and other required certifications were verified  and placed in her file, training on the Epic electronic health record was  arranged and the Outpatient Orientation was scheduled and completed. This  involved the use of the Onboarding Cascading Roles and Responsibilities Table  to orient her to the roles and expectations of the orientee, preceptor, nurse  manager and education coordinator.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-4.pdf">(Evidence SE7-4, Campbell Welcome Email, Orientation Calendar,  Attendance Email, Ambulatory Leadership and Departmental Orientation Checklist)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Campbell&rsquo;s  schedule and orientation goals were documented on the Phase I, II and III  Universal Interdisciplinary and Role-specific Orientation Pathways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Phase  I – Exploring the New Territory (Orthopedic Surgery Clinic); 2/29/16–3/25/16</u><br>
  During  her first four weeks, Campbell oriented directly with her preceptor and  attended the standing patient care and educational trainings for Orthopedic  Surgery. Campbell directly observed patients with Mulkey and other clinical  nurses during Phase I, and she participated in department-specific learning  activities and required didactic sessions during weeks two and three. </p>

<h3>Example Two: Effective Transition  to Practice of Advanced Practice Registered Nurses </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
  Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital (TCH) has been  consistently increasing its number of advanced practice registered nurses  (APRN). Prior to 2013, an orientation pathway served as the guide for new  advanced practice nurses and preceptors to use. Following the development of  the TCH Transformational Advanced Professional Practice Model, the Advanced  Practice Providers Practice Advisory Council, under the direction of Elizabeth  Elliott, MSN, APRN, NNP-BC, Director of Advanced Practice Providers, created  the TCH Transition to Practice (TTP) Program. The work group consisted of  members of the council, who developed the program and associated tools. The TTP  Program was subsequently approved by the Advanced Practice Providers Practice  Advisory Council and launched in 2013. </p>

<p>The  Transformational Advanced Professional Practice Model and the TTP Program are  based on Patricia Benner&rsquo;s Novice to Expert model, which recognizes the  importance of the progression of professional development based on a  collaborative team-based approach. <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  TTP Program supports all new graduates, experienced and returning to practice APRNs.  The opportunities for role clarity, increasing skill level and development as a  professional APRN were key in developing the program. Effective preceptorship  and mentorship are also key program components. <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a new hire, the task of  incorporating and developing new specialty knowledge and skills can be  overwhelming. The overall aim of the Transition to Practice Orientation Pathway  is to standardize the process of onboarding into an Acute Care advance practice  provider role. Preceptor and orientee expectations are outlined to establish  the optimal learning period for the new hire in order to lay a strong foundation  for their advance practice provider scope of practice.<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-6.pdf"> (Evidence  SE7-6, TCH Acute Care Advanced Practice Provider Transition to Practice  Pathway) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Process: Transition to Practice Program</strong><br>
  After a  review of the current literature and discussions with other leaders across the  organization, the Advanced Practice Providers Practice  Advisory Council determined  that the TTP Program would consist of a phased approach to APRNs&rsquo; transition  into the organization:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Phase I – Exploring the New Territory</li>
  <li>Phase II – Building a Foundation</li>
  <li>Phase       III – Patient-Care Engagement </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Phase I – Exploring the New Territory</em><br>
  During  Phase I, the program supports APRNs by providing a structured shadowing  experience with a trained APRN. The focus is on providing opportunities for  networking with other APRNs and familiarizing the new APRNs with the  departmental processes.  During this  phase, the APRN has protected time away from direct patient management to allow  for assimilation into the work groups. APRNs are encouraged to participate in  department-specific learning activities and to begin networking with APRNs  outside their specific area of practice. Phase I is anticipated to last for the  first three weeks of practice <em><u></u></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Phase II – Building a Foundation: Focus on  Specialty Knowledge</em><br>
  Immediately  following Phase I, Phase II of the TTP Program gives structure to educational  content in the practice area. The program supports a didactic learning  experience, allowing the APRN to spend protected time in an immersion  opportunity related to specific patient diagnoses and management strategies  that support best practice. This phase also begins the incorporation of the  critical thinking skills needed to manage patients, with constant mentoring on  patient management from the APRN&rsquo;s preceptor and leaders. This phase supports  the APRN to develop the skills and procedures needed to care for their specific  patient population. The program provides a framework that supports case  presentations comprising elements of competencies specific to APRN practice.  These formal presentations are made to the work teams and to the section  physician partner. Phase II is anticipated to last for three weeks of practice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Phase III – Patient Care Engagement</em><br>
  Phase III  covers the last six weeks of the TTP Program, during which the APRN is  challenged to use the knowledge gained over the previous six weeks. This phase  begins the hands-on direct patient management. The program is developed to  support a gradual increase in the number of patients based on the APRN&rsquo;s skill  level. Frequent evaluations are provided by the preceptor to encourage  independent practice. The APRN is given protected time to develop skills in  case presentations, procedures and other skills needed for the care of the  patient.  </p>

<p><strong>Evaluation of the TTP Program</strong><br>
  <span class="additional_docs_yellow">The responsibility for evaluating the  Transition to Practice Program lies within the scope of the Advanced Practice  Providers Practice Advisory Council, as  outlined in the council&rsquo;s bylaws. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">In June 2017, an email with an  electronic link to a survey was forwarded to participants of the Transition to  Practice (TTP) Program since 2014.&nbsp; There were 25 recipients to the email  with 11 respondents, yielding a response rate of 44%.&nbsp;One of the  respondents did not participate in the program, leaving a total of 10  participants&rsquo; responses that were analyzed. The majority of respondents agreed  that they successfully transitioned into their advanced practice role and  received appropriate support from their preceptor (63%), leader (88%), physician  (90%), and department (90%). <a href="../Evidence/SE7d-a.pdf">(Evidence SE7d-a, Advanced  Practice Providers Practice Advisory Council Charter, Transition to Practice  Program Survey Results) </a></p>

Although a limitation of the survey is the number of respondents  (N=10), the data surrounding the preceptor is significant enough to cause  review of the education, training, and selection of the preceptor. There was  agreement among the Advanced Practice Providers Practice Advisory Council members  that preceptor selection is key to the success of the advanced practice provider.  The Advanced Practice Providers Practice Advisory Council will move forward  with developing preceptor guidelines, defining the role of the preceptor, and  qualifications that will benefit the onboarding of the new advanced practice provider.  There was unanimous agreement among the Advanced Practice Providers Practice  Advisory Council Members, that the current objectives remain unchanged and  reviewed after the next annual survey. The Advanced Practice Providers Practice  Advisory Council voted to conduct an annual survey to gather inferential  statistics to determine the probability that an observed difference between  groups is dependable, or that this data finding might have happened by chance. <a href="../Evidence/SE7d-b.pdf">(Evidence SE7d-b, APP Practice Advisory Council  Attendance Sheet, Agenda and Meeting Minutes, Presentation) </a></p>

<p align="center">SE7, Case Example Participants: Transition  to Practice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrea  Sawyer-Gray, MSN, APRN, CPNP-AC, started as a nurse practitioner in Cardiology  on September 14, 2014. Constance Cephus, PhD, APRN, CPNP-AC/PC, NNP-BC, Nurse  Practitioner in Cardiology at the time, and Mary Hoang, MSN, APRN,  CPNP-AC/PC,  Nurse Practitioner in  Cardiology, served as her preceptors. Tony Mott, MD, Medical Director of  Cardiology, was her delegating physician. Sawyer-Gray reported directly to  Angela Gooden, MSN, APRN, CPNP-AC/PC, Manager, Advanced Practice Providers for  Cardiology, and up to Suzette Stone, MSN, MDiv, PPCNP-BC, APRN, CPHON,  Assistant Director for Advanced Practice Providers at the time. Sawyer-Gray&rsquo;s  individualized Transition to Practice (TTP) Orientation Pathway contained  action items addressing essential job accountabilities, learning resources,  validation criteria and performance validation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TTP  Checklist items began with the receipt of her Orientation Pathway, and included  introduction to policies, procedures, credentialing and tools required for the  role, such as pagers, keys, phone codes, business cards and lab coats. Medical  Staff Credentialing was outlined and completed. Epic, electronic health record  training was arranged, a billing class was scheduled, and the roles and  expectations of the orientee, preceptor, delegating physician and nurse leaders  (manager and assistant director) were explained.  <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-8.pdf">(Evidence SE7-8,  Transition to Practice Orientation Pathway- Andrea Sawyer-Gray, MSN, APRN,  CPNP-AC) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sawyer-Gray&rsquo;s  schedule, orientation goals and personal goals were documented on the Phase I,  II and III schedules and goals forms. <a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-9.pdf">(Evidence  SE7-9, TTP Phases I, II and III Schedules- Andrea Sawyer-Gray, MSN, APRN,  CPNP-AC)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Phase  I – Exploring the New Territory (Cardiology); 9/15/14–10/4/14</u><br>
  During  her first three weeks, Sawyer-Gray oriented directly with her preceptor and  attended the standing patient care and educational conferences respective to  Cardiology. She directly observed consults with her preceptor and other nurse  practitioners during this period. She also participated in department-specific  learning activities such as Surgery Conference, Heart Center Quality Forum,  Fraser&rsquo;s Conference, Pediatric Grand Rounds, Fellow&rsquo;s Conference,  Cardiovascular Surgery QI Conference, Echo Conference and numerous didactic  sessions during weeks two and three. </p>

<p><u>Phase  II – Building a Foundation: Focus on Specialty Knowledge; 10/5/14–10/18/14</u></p>
Immediately following  Phase I, Sawyer-Gray continued to attend various conferences, presented case  studies and continued to participate in consults with her preceptors and other  nurse practitioners. She continued with self-study, participating in consults  with her preceptor and attending the cardiology-related conferences.  Sawyer-Gray concluded Phase II with an end of Phase II meeting with Gooden<strong> </strong>on October 10, 2014.

<p><u>Phase  III – Patient-Care Engagement; 10/19/14–11/29/14 </u><br>
  Phase III  covers the last six weeks of the TTP Program, during which the APRN is challenged  to use the knowledge gained over the previous six weeks. This phase begins the  hands-on direct patient management. The program is developed to support a  gradual increase in the number of patients based on the APRN&rsquo;s skill level.  APRNs are also given weekly informal evaluations by their preceptor to encourage  independent practice. The APRNs are given protected time to develop skills in  case presentations, procedures and other skills needed for the care of the  patient.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During  this time, Sawyer-Gray worked closely with her preceptors Cephus and Hoang to  identify areas of clinical need based on a review of the cardiology-specific  orientation pathway. This allowed them to actively seek common patient  experiences that she would need to be comfortable with prior to the end of  orientation.</p>

<p>Sawyer-Gray completed her orientation pathway  on December 1, 2014, and presented her final case study, on truncus arteriosus,  to the Cardiology Department on January, 28, 2015.  Work on the presentation is encouraged  throughout the orientation period, with progress assessed during each end of  phase meeting. Its completion is not a requirement for the successful  completion of orientation, but a presentation date is agreed upon during the  end of orientation meeting and scheduled during the monthly section meetings.<a href="../../Attachments/PDF/SE7-10.pdf"> (Evidence  SE7-10, Truncus Arteriosus presentation- Andrea Sawyer-Gray, MSN, APRN,  CPNP-AC)</a>  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the best indicators of Sawyer-Gray&rsquo;s successful transition to practice has  been feedback from Mott and APRNs who she works with. The following are  Gooden&rsquo;s comments from Sawyer-Gray&rsquo;s first annual performance review in  November 2015:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &ldquo;I cannot say enough about  Sawyer-Gray&rsquo;s contribution to this team. She came as a new provider to a very  busy and complex consult service and has done a wonderful job. Her success in  this role is a testament to her hard work and mental toughness. I can't wait to  see how she continues to grow in her role as an APRN and I am happy to have her  on my team. Over the next year I expect to see her continue to grow clinically  and to start adding other professional development activities<em>.</em>&rdquo;</p>
