<h3><span class="additional_docs_yellow">Example  One: Neonatal Cooling – Care Coordination and Continuity through  Interprofessional Collaborative Practice</span></h3>
<br>
  <strong>Background</strong><br>
Hypoxemic  ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), caused by perinatal asphyxia, is a significant  cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic hypothermia has emerged  as a state of the art treatment for neonates with HIE. The challenge has been  to ensure that the cooling of the infant is initiated upon arrival to the  outlying hospital and is continued as care is transitioned to the Newborn  Center team at Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital (TCH). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  November 2013, TCH Transport Services, in conjunction with the Newborn Center  NICU clinical nurse experts, physicians and respiratory therapists, reviewed  evidence-based literature on the cooling of patients with HIE which showed that  neurodevelopmental outcomes are improved for 1-3 per 1,000 live births if the  intervention of active cooling is initiated within six hours of birth. <span class="additional_docs_yellow">Based on this identified need  and evidence-based practice literature, the Therapeutic Hypothermia Work Group developed a TCH Total Body  Cooling Protocol specifically for transporting and cooling neonate patients  with HIE.</span> The Therapeutic Hypothermia Work Group selected the CritiCool cooling  device to be used with care coordination and continuity of care during  transport and continued through admission. Using the same cooling device during  transport and the hospital stay ensures a consistent cooling methodology.<span class="additional_docs_yellow"> <a href="../Evidence/EP5a-a.pdf">(Evidence  EP5a-a, Guidelines for Acute Care of the Neonate, Transport Cooling Process, Cooling  Admission Checklist)</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="additional_docs_yellow">In January 2014, Jennifer Bee, BSN, RN, CCRN,  Decentralized Education Coordinator, Transport Services, and Allison Walton,  BSN, RNC-NIC, Decentralized Education Coordinator, Newborn Center NICU, created  the Total Body Cooling PowerPoint presentation. This was incorporated into the  education on the use of the TCH Neonatal Cooling Protocol, which was provided  beginning in February 2014.</span> Bee and Walton developed education in the form of in-services for the  Transport Services clinical experts and the Newborn Center NICU clinical  nurses. To ensure the success of this initiative, consistent education would  need to be provided to the transport team and the Newborn Center NICU clinical  nurses, physicians and respiratory therapists. A PowerPoint was used for the  education of all groups, and a monthly newsletter that included updates was  distributed through email in the Newborn Center NICU and posted in designated  areas. <a href="../Evidence/EP5-2.pdf">(Evidence EP5-2, Total Body Cooling  Education PowerPoint</a>)  The  clinical impact of coordinated and continuous care for this critical patient  population was recognized nationally. Bee and Tonya Jack, MSN, RN, CCRN, CMTE,  Manager Clinical Transport, Transport Services, were accepted to present &ldquo;Neonatal Cooling on Ground  Transports&rdquo; at an American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Conference section on  Transport Medicine. <a href="../Evidence/EP5-4.pdf">(Evidence EP5-4, Cooling Poster) </a></p>

<p class="additional_docs_yellow"><strong>Nurses&rsquo;  Involvement in Interprofessional Collaborative Practice for Care Coordination  and Continuity of Care</strong><br>
  When the TCH Transfer Center (currently  known as the Nerve Center) is contacted by the referring hospital with a  transfer request for an HIE patient who requires total body cooling, the call  is received by a transport communication specialist to start the intake process.  The transport communication specialist pages the transport team, and the call  is then transferred to the Transport Services charge nurse for the continuation  of the intake process. The Transport Services charge nurse conferences in the Newborn  Center Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) transport attending physician to  complete the intake and for coordination of care. The NICU transport attending physician  receives report from the referring physician to discuss whether the patient  meets the inclusion criteria for the TCH Total Body Cooling Protocol. Once the  NICU transport attending physician accepts the transfer of the patient, the Transport  Services charge nurse notifies the transport communication specialist in the Transfer  Center of the acceptance for transfer. The Transport Services charge nurse  continues care coordination with the referring physician or registered nurse by  requesting a fax number to submit the TCH Neonatal Cooling Protocol. The  instructions to initiate cooling include: </p>
<ul>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Check axillary temperature every 15  minutes</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Stop the cooling process and turn the  warmer back on if the patient&rsquo;s temperature falls below 33.5°C</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Turn the warmer off if patient&rsquo;s  temperature is above 34.5°C </li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Contact the Transport Services charge  nurse with questions or recommendations related to the cooling patient</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">The transport communication specialist  informs the referring physician or designee of the name of the accepting  physician. The Transport Services charge nurse notifies the Newborn Center NICU  charge nurse of the patient&rsquo;s medical history. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  Transport Services team receives a request for the transport of a patient with  a diagnosis of HIE and the Transport Services nurse begins the process by  obtaining the CritiCool cooling device for transport. </p><p class="additional_docs_yellow">The Transport Services team, which consists of a clinical  nurse, respiratory therapist, transport emergency medical technician (EMT) and neonatal  nurse practitioner (if patient condition is unstable), travels to receive the  patient from the referring hospital. On arrival to the referring hospital unit,  the Transport Services nurse, the neonatal nurse practitioner and the  respiratory therapist receive updated patient report, assess the patient and  formulate a plan of care for transport. The Transport Services nurse or  neonatal nurse practitioner will contact the Newborn Center NICU transport  attending physician to discuss the patient findings and transport care plan. In  preparation for transfer, the Transport Service team completes the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Transport nurse and respiratory  therapist place patient in CritiCool blanket</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Transport nurse places rectal  temperature probe</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Transport nurse and respiratory  therapist record temperature every 15 minutes</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Patient secured in neutral thermal  environment by Transport Services team</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Transport nurse and neonatal nurse  practitioner obtain transport consent, and family is updated on plan of care </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">The Transport Services team loads the  patient in the ambulance, and the transport nurse initiates the active cooling.  The transport nurse or neonatal nurse practitioner calls the Newborn Center NICU  charge nurse 30 minutes prior to arrival to give an updated report for  continuity of care. During the transfer, the transport nurse and respiratory  therapist monitor and document the patient&rsquo;s vital signs, airway and  neurological status. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">Upon arrival to TCH, the patient is  transported to the Newborn Center NICU, where the Transport Services team  transitions the care of the patient over to the Newborn Center NICU interprofessional  team, which comprises clinical nurses, a neonatal nurse practitioner, a  critical care physician and a respiratory therapist. The Transport Services  team gives report on the patient to the parents and the interprofessional team for  continuation of the TCH Total Body Cooling Protocol. In the initial assessment,  the Newborn Center NICU clinical nurse:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Unwraps the patient</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Removes the rectal temperature probe</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Inserts the esophageal temperature probe</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Re-wraps the patient in the cooling blanket </li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Starts the CritiCool machine</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">The Newborn Center NICU clinical nurse  assists the respiratory therapist with securement of the patient&rsquo;s airway. The neonatal  nurse practitioner, in collaboration with the critical care physician, places  the orders to continue the TCH Total Body Cooling Protocol. The neonatal nurse  practitioner reviews the TCH Total Body Cooling Protocol and the plan of care with  the Newborn Center NICU clinical nurse. If intravenous access is needed, the  neonatal nurse practitioner or critical care physician attempts to place an umbilical  arterial catheter or an umbilical venous catheter. The Newborn Center clinical  nurse assists the electroencephalogram (EEG) technician with placement of the  electrodes for continuous video EEG monitoring. During the 72 hours of cooling,  the Newborn Center NICU clinical nurse closely monitors the patient&rsquo;s vital  signs and neurological status until the patient achieves an esophageal core temperature  of 33.5°C. </p>

If the patient&rsquo;s  neurological status and airway is stable, the neonatal nurse practitioner discontinues  the TCH Total Body Cooling Protocol, including the ventilator and the EEG  monitoring. <a href="../Evidence/EP5a-b.pdf">(Evidence  EP5a-b, Transfer Center Cooling Process, Neonatal Cooling Protocol, NICU-Total  Body Cooling Process, NICU Bedside Rounds, Language Barrier Procedure) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow"><strong>Patient  Example of Care Coordination and Continuity of Care through Interprofessional  Collaborative Practice</strong><br>
  In August 2016, the TCH Transfer Center  received a call from a referring hospital requesting transfer of a delivered  39-week infant diagnosed with HIE for total body cooling. Due to antepartum and  delivery complications, the infant experienced severe respiratory distress with  neurological deficits, which required a neonatal nurse practitioner for  transport. The transport communication specialist initiated the intake process,  paged the transport team and transferred the call to the Transport Services  charge nurse for the continuation of the intake process. The Transport Services  team, comprising the transport nurse, neonatal nurse practitioner, respiratory  therapist and an EMT, prepared for the transport. The transport nurse retrieved  the CritiCool device for transport. The Transport Services charge nurse  conferenced the Newborn Center NICU transport attending physician for report  and acceptance of the transfer. Once the Newborn Center NICU transport attending  physician determined the patient met the inclusion criteria for the TCH Total  Body Cooling Protocol, the Transport Services charge nurse completed the intake  and began the coordination of care by asking the nurse at the referring hospital  to initiate the TCH Neonatal Cooling Protocol. The Transport Services charge  nurse notified the transport communication specialist of acceptance for  transfer and notified the Newborn Center NICU charge of the patient&rsquo;s medical  history. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">On arrival to the referring hospital, the  Transport Services team received an update on the patient&rsquo;s status from the  referring hospital unit. The Transport Services team, Elizabeth Mallet, BSN,  RN, CCRN, Christopher Dischler, MSN, APRN, NNP-BC, and Ray Estlinbaum, RRT,  NPS, CNPT, assessed the patient and formulated a plan for transfer. Dischler  contacted Maria Reyes, MD, the attending physician covering TCH Transport  Services, to give report on the initial assessment and review the plan of care.  Prior to departure, the Transport Services team took the patient to the  mother&rsquo;s room, where Mallet and Dischler obtained transport consent and updated  the family on the plan of care using an interpreter. At five hours of age,  Mallet placed the patient in the CritiCool cooling blanket, and the Transport  Services team placed the patient into the transport incubator with neutral  thermal environment. Mallet, Dischler and Estlinbaum secured and loaded the  patient onto the ambulance and continued the TCH Total Body Cooling Protocol. Mallet  and Dischler monitored the patient&rsquo;s vital signs and neurological status.  Mallet obtained labs, started the morphine drip and administered antibiotics. Estlinbaum  monitored the patient&rsquo;s airway and modified the ventilator settings. Dischler, in  collaboration with Mallet, called Newborn Center NICU charge nurse Leanna  Copenhaver, RN to provide an updated report on the patient&rsquo;s status. <a href="../Evidence/EP5a-c.pdf">(Evidence EP5a-c, Memorandum  of Transfer, Transport Services-Kangaroo Crew Transport Notes) </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">The patient was intubated, placed on  the cooling blanket and transported to the Newborn Center NICU accompanied by  the Transport Services team. Mallet, Dischler and Estlinbaum provided a full  bedside report to the Newborn Center NICU clinical nurse Sheryl Wallis, RN;  Copenhaver; Sasha Galan, RT, Respiratory Care Services; and Advanced Practice  Provider Crystal Hockaday, MSN, APRN, NNP-BC. In collaboration with Gautham Suresh,  MD, Neonatologist, attending physician at the time, Shino Thomas, MSN, APRN,  NNP-BC, placed the order for the TCH Total Body Cooling Protocol in the  electronic medical record. Thomas reviewed the orders of the TCH Total Body  Cooling Protocol with Wallis to ensure the transition and continuation of care  was maintained. Wallis assessed the patient and connected the patient to the CritiCool  device at the bedside, while Copenhaver retrieved initial labs and contacted  radiology for a chest x-ray to verify placement of the umbilical arterial  catheter and the endotracheal tube. Wallis monitored the temperature  continuously via esophageal probe that was confirmed by x-ray. Galan completed  an assessment on the patient&rsquo;s respiratory status to maintain the airway and ensure  proper ventilator settings. Suresh consulted the pediatric neurologist for the  initiation of continuous EEG monitoring and, with Wallis&rsquo; assistance, Anita  Thompson, EEG Technician, performed the baseline EEG. Suresh completed his  assessment and documented the plan of care for the interprofessional  collaborative team. For additional intravenous access, Hockaday placed an  umbilical venous catheter with support from Newborn Center NICU clinical nurse  Jessica Gomez, RN and the supervision of Suresh, for prolonged IV therapy,  medication administration and parenteral nutrition. Copenhaver contacted  radiology for another chest x-ray to verify the umbilical venous catheter. <a href="../Evidence/EP5a-d.pdf">(Evidence EP5a-d, Documentation in Patient Electronic  Medical Record)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">During the patient&rsquo;s admission, the Newborn  Center NICU interprofessional collaborative team met daily for care progression  rounds led by the Newborn Center NICU charge nurse to discuss the patient&rsquo;s  medical history, physical assessment and the plan of care to identify any  potential needs or barriers in caring for the patient. The Newborn Center NICU  clinical nurse led bedside rounds twice a day with the interprofessional team to  discuss the active problems, the reason the patient was in the Newborn Center NICU,  concerns from the past 24 hours and the plan of care. After rounding, the Newborn  Center NICU interprofessional team documented daily in the patient&rsquo;s progress  notes. Jacqueline Williams, RN, Care Manager, assessed the discharge planning and  continued to follow the patient with the interprofessional team to assess for  needs. Rose Toruno, Occupational Therapist, reviewed the patient&rsquo;s chart and deferred  the evaluation until the TCH Total Body Cooling Protocol was completed to  assess the occupational needs and readiness.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">On August 9, 2016, Advanced Practice  Provider Whitney Sansotta, MSN, APRN, NNP-BC, noted that the patient was  stable. Sansotta ordered an MRI of the brain without contrast with spectroscopy  and discontinued the continuous EEG monitoring per the TCH Total Body Cooling  Protocol. Using an interpreter from the language services line, Sansotta  provided an update to the mother that the patient was stable and the TCH Total  Body Cooling Protocol would be discontinued. In addition, Sansotta gained  consent from the mother to use donor breast milk until she was able to provide  expressed breast milk.  With the  interprofessional team at the patient&rsquo;s bedside, Sansotta extubated the patient,  who tolerated the procedure well. Lactation assistant Sonia Castillo was  notified when the mother arrived at the bedside to provide a consultation, tour  of the milk bank, supplies and the breastfeeding education handout. The  interprofessional collaborative team provided discharge education and made  follow-up appointments with the pediatrician, neurology as well as the  developmental consult. <a href="../Evidence/EP5a-e.pdf">(Evidence EP5a-e, Care  Progression Rounds, Patient Electronic Medical Record Notes)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow"><strong>Outcome </strong><br>
  Nurses&rsquo; involvement in interprofessional  collaborative practice and care coordination ensured the continuity of care of  this patient. The patient was discharged at day 12 of life with no documented  neurological deficits at the time of discharge. Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital is  one of the few hospitals in Texas that provides active cooling. Since the implementation  of the TCH Total Body Cooling Protocol, TCH transports each year approximately  16 HIE patients who require active cooling. TCH Transport Services and Newborn  Center NICU nurses, in collaboration with the interprofessional team, provide  care coordination and continuity of care for optimal neurological outcomes for  this patient population. </p>
