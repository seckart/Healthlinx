<p><em>An action plan that includes a target and  demonstrates evidence of progress toward 80% of registered nurses obtaining a  baccalaureate or graduate degree in nursing by 2020. Include an assessment of  the current status; an evaluation of methods and strategies to increase the  educational level of the workforce; and an appraisal of established, realistic  targets to meet the organization's strategy to increase the number of  registered nurses with a degree in nursing (baccalaureate or graduate degree).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategies</strong><br>
  In fiscal  year 2014 (October 2013-September 2014), the Nursing Executive Leadership Team,  comprising the CNO and vice presidents of nursing, evaluated and implemented six  specific strategies to increase the percentage of nurses with a BSN or higher  degree.  Strategies included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nurse education  tracking</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Establish  sound repository for accurate collection and reporting of nursing education  data through implementation of an electronic Nursing Professional Portfolio.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>BSN Projections</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Detailed  analysis of the additional number of BSN nurses needed to comply with Institute  of Medicine 80% recommendations.</li>
    <li>Include  goals within the Nursing Strategic Plan to support projections.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Assess existing  resources for nurse education, and secure additional funds</li>
  <li>Everyone&rsquo;s  A Recruiter Now (E.A.R.N.): Advertise and educate employees on the E.A.R.N.  referral bonus program. (Evidence OO7-1, E.A.R.N.  Internal Employee Program Flyer, Let&rsquo;s Hire 100 Nurses in 100 Days! How Can I  Help Recruit?)</li>
  <li>Partnered  with human resources to ensure tuition assistance program is comparable to  other Texas Medical Center hospitals. (Evidence  OO5-6, Tuition Assistance Program Policy)</li>
  <li>Partnered  with Development to secure donors to fund nursing scholarships. TCH nurses with  associate degrees now eligible for additional funding for BSN education, up to  $5250.  (Evidence  OO7-3, Nursing Congress Email – Going Back To School, Voice Of Nursing Blog  Post)</li>
  <li>Facilitate staff access  to education for BSN or higher</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure  awareness and understanding of existing resources available.</li>
    <li>Establish  online and local educational partners.</li>
    <li>Offering  tuition discounts to TCH employees and on-site recruitment initiatives. (Evidence OO7-4, <a href="http://www.edassist.com/client-company/texaschildrenshospital/matrix">http://www.edassist.com/client-company/texaschildrenshospital/matrix</a>) </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Establish education  support for incumbents and changes with new hire requirements</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Promote  flexible scheduling options.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Shift  in hiring standards to target BSN nurses.</li>
  <li>CNO  approval is required for all associate degree nurses (ADN) before hiring. </li>
  <li>The  nurse is required to sign a commitment to enroll in a BSN program within six  months of hire date, with a plan to graduate within two years of entering that  program. (Evidence OO7-5, Commitment to Enrolling  to a BSN Program)</li>
  <li>Hardwire processes for  monitoring BSN rate progress </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Quarterly  review of the BSN rate</li>
    <li>Quarterly  assessment of the nursing strategic plan</li>

    <td width="385" valign="top"><p>E.A.R.N.    – When initiating the hiring of 100 RNs in 100 days campaign, the nurse    leaders and nurse managers evaluated the E.A.R.N. program and opportunities    to increase its awareness to employees. Certain RN positions were placed in &ldquo;Super    Red Hot&rdquo; or &ldquo;Red Hot&rdquo; job categories, which would reward the employee up to    $5000. Nurses hired from the E.A.R.N. program include 51 nurses in 2014, 86    nurses in 2015, and 116 nurses in 2016, demonstrating an increase over time.</p>
      <p>Currently,    TCH tuition reimbursement is $2500 annually for full-time employees and $1500    annually for part-time employees.  Texas    Children&rsquo;s Hospital tuition assistance program is reviewed annually and continues    to be competitive and aligned with other hospitals in the surrounding area.  </p>
      <p>The    additional BSN scholarship assistance has been identified as the best strategy    to increase the organization&rsquo;s BSN rate. In December 2013, a survey was    conducted of ADN/Diploma Registered Nurses, where 100 of 194 respondents    stated that finances was the number one barrier to returning back to school. On    June 10, 2015, Texas Children&rsquo;s received an Exxon/Mobile grant to provide supplemental    tuition assistance to ADN/Diploma Registered Nurses enrolled or enrolling in    a RN-BSN program, in addition to the current TCH tuition reimbursement    amounts listed above.  Full-time nurses    are eligible for an additional $2750 per semester and part-time nurses are    eligible for an additional $1375 per semester under this grant.  As of November 2016, 111 (92 full-time, 19    part-time) Texas Children&rsquo;s ADN/Diploma nurses have enrolled in a RN-BSN    program benefiting from the supplemental tuition assistance. In addition, 39    nurses have graduated with the assistance of supplemental funding. The total    amount of funding paid out from June 2015 to November 2016 has exceeded    $214,000 with more than $15,000 in additional funds pending. This program has    a positive impact on nurses obtaining their BSN and effectively shown an    improvement in the BSN rate.</p></td>

    <td width="385" valign="top"><p>The majority of clinical nurses&rsquo;    in the inpatient and Ambulatory setting educational needs are met through the    annual TCH Nursing Professional Day Conference. The annual 2016 Nursing    Professional Day Conference was held in Summer 2016 at the Medical Center    Campus, and in Fall 2016 at the West Campus in Katy. TCH educational partners,    including sixteen local and online universities, were present during this    conference to answer questions nurses had in regards to their RN-BSN, MSN or    DNP programs. </p>
      <p>Texas Children&rsquo;s Tuition Assistance    program provides both education advising and tuition    prepay/reimbursement.  TCH partners    with EdAssist (an education management company) that networks with a variety    of schools to offer tuition discount for TCH employees.  Both the education advising and tuition    prepay/reimbursement have been effective ways to support nurses to achieve a    BSN or higher degrees.  </p></td>

      <p>Nurse    Leaders evaluate the percentage of ADN/Diploma and BSN nurses hired annually    to ensure an increase of BSN hires over time.     As noted below, the percentage of hiring BSN or higher degree nurses has    continued to increase over the past four years:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2013 – 18%    ADNs/Diploma Nurses hired</li>
      </ul>
      <p>                  82% BSN or higher level of    degree      hired</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2014 – 16%    ADNs/Diploma Nurses hired</li>
      </ul>
      <p>                  84% BSN or higher level of    degree  hired</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2015 – 13%    ADNs/Diploma Nurses hired</li>
      </ul>
      <p>                  87% BSN or higher level of    degree  hired</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2016 – 13%    ADNs/Diploma Nurses hired</li>
      </ul>
      <p>                  87% BSN or higher level of    degree  Hired</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Effective    November 2013, all ADN/Diploma Nurses required an approval for hire from the    Chief Nurse Officer. After approval, the human resource department obtained a    verbal agreement with the ADN/Diploma Nurse to enroll in a RN-BSN program    within six months. In 2015, nurse leaders and nurse managers evaluated this    process and noted some ADN/Diploma Nurses were non-compliant with the verbal    agreement. In January 2016, the new Chief Nurse Officer implemented a written    contract to the process. This written contract requires the nurse to enroll    in a BSN program within six months of hire and a plan to graduate within two    years of entering the program. There is a centralized tracking mechanism for    all ADN/diploma nurses to ensure staff are meeting their educational    milestones.  As of November 2016, 24    nurses have received their BSN, and 52 nurses are currently enrolled in a    RN-BSN program which has successfully met the expectation of the ADN/Diploma    contract, and directly influenced the BSN rate.</p></td>

<p><strong>Assessment of Current Status</strong><br>
  In June 2016,  the Nursing Executive Council (NEC) assessed the current percentage of direct  care nurses practicing at Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital (TCH) with a BSN or higher  degree. The NEC comprises the senior vice president/chief nursing officer  (CNO), executive vice president, executive vice president (Nursing and Pavilion  for Women), executives – those with nursing direct reports – including CNO  executive reports, Ambulatory, Surgical Services, Pavilion for Women, West  Campus/<br>
  Woodlands/The  Centers for Women and Children, Texas Children&rsquo;s Pediatrics, executive of Human  Resources, executive Ancillary Services and Research, executive of Care  Management and Family Services, and executive of Quality and Safety. Their  assessment demonstrated that 80.37% of nurses have a BSN or higher degree, and  that this percentage has increased each year since 2013.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Evidence OO7-1, Percentage  of Nurses with a BSN or Higher Degree</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a quarterly  basis, Sarah Marcion, BSN, RN, Assistant Director of Magnet, reports data on the percentage of nurses with a BSN or higher  degree to Emily Weber, MS, RN, NEA-BC, Director of Acute Care Services &amp; Magnet  Program Director, and Mary Jo André, MSN, RN, NEA-BC, Senior Vice President,  Chief Nursing Officer. In addition, Marcion presents the percentage report to the  Nursing Coordinating Council (NCC) every other month. NCC comprises nursing leadership  from across all campuses and shared governance officers from each council. This  keeps all nurse leaders informed in order to maintain the current performance  of 80% nurses with a BSN or higher degree. (Evidence OO7-6, Nursing Coordinating Council July 2016  Attendance Sheet, Meeting Minutes and Presentation)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Future Goals</strong><br>
  The Nursing  Executive Council determined that the strategies set in place in fiscal year  2014 have been effective in increasing TCH&rsquo;s percentage of nurses with a BSN or  higher degree, which was above the NDNQI benchmarking group. To maintain  current performance and continue to increase the percentage of nurses with a BSN  or higher degree, the NEC set a goal for FY 2016 through 2018 to increase the BSN  degree nurse rate to over 80%. The strategic plan is readily available for all  employees to view on the TCH intranet, Connect website, under &ldquo;Nursing  Resources.&rdquo; (Evidence OO7-7, Texas Children&rsquo;s  Hospital Intranet Connect Page, Nursing Resources, Nursing Strategic Plan) </p>
