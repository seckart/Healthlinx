<h3>Decreasing  the Rate of Admissions of DKA Patients from within Region IV to the Pulmonary  Adolescent Endocrine Unit</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background/Problem</strong><br>
  Houston is the  nation&rsquo;s fourth-largest city, and families who reside in the area come from a  variety of backgrounds and have a variety of needs. Region IV includes the  public schools in seven counties in and around the greater Houston area. This  large region contains 54 school districts with a total of 1,294 campuses: 750  elementary schools, 203 middle schools, 49 junior high schools, 143 high  schools and 25 elementary through secondary schools. Region IV serves 1,038,480  students, which is one fourth of the state&rsquo;s public school students. <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>School-aged  and adolescent children with diabetes are faced with multiple challenges in  managing their disease. From January 2015 through March 2015, clinical nurses  at Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital (TCH) Diabetes and Endocrine Care Clinic  identified an increase in phone calls from Region IV school nurses expressing  concerns and asking questions about the treatment and management of diabetic  patients in the schools. A multidisciplinary team consisting of clinical  nurses/certified diabetes educators, a dietician and physicians were concerned  about the inconsistent education being provided by school nurses in the Region  IV schools. The school nurses were using multiple school packets that contained  information they needed to care for and manage diabetic children during school  hours. However, the multidisciplinary team was concerned about inconsistencies  in the education being provided through these multiple packets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The multidisciplinary  team theorized that the inconsistent education, and thus the inconsistent management  of diabetic children in the schools, was contributing to the increase in admissions  of DKA patients to the Pulmonary Adolescent Endocrine Unit (14 WT). Diabetic ketoacidosis  (DKA) is an acute, major, life-threatening complication of diabetes that occurs  mainly in patients with type 1 diabetes. DKA is usually trigged by an illness  or a problem with insulin therapy. Missed insulin treatments or inadequate  insulin therapy can leave the body with too little insulin in the bloodstream,  triggering DKA. The multidisciplinary team was concerned that the improper  management and care of the diabetic population in the Region IV schools was  contributing to the increased admissions of DKA  patients to the Pulmonary Adolescent Endocrine Unit (14 WT). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">From January 2015 through March 2015, the rate of admissions  of DKA patients from within Region IV to the Pulmonary Adolescent Endocrine Unit  (14WT) was 0.48. This rate is calculated by dividing the number of DKA  admissions from within Region IV to 14 WT by the total number of all Region IV diabetic  patients admitted to 14 WT. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal Statement</strong> <br>
  <span class="additional_docs_yellow">Decrease the rate of admissions of DKA patients from  within Region IV to the Pulmonary Adolescent Endocrine Unit (14 WT). </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description of the  Intervention/Initiative/Activities</strong><br>
  The  intervention period was April 2015 to September 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>April 2015</u><br>
  In April 2015,  the TCH Diabetes  and Endocrine Care Clinic established a  diabetic community outreach task force. The task force comprised clinical  nurses/certified diabetes educators (CDE), a dietician and physicians. <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>May 2015–June 2015</u><br>
  From May 2015 to June 2015, the community outreach  task force determined that the content of the Region IV school packets needed  to be revised and that the education provided in them needed to be  standardized. The task force compared the multiple school packets to identify  redundancies and determine the critical information that needed to be included for  Region IV school nurses to be able to provide high-quality and standardized  care to the diabetic population during school hours. The task force condensed  the multiple school packets into one packet to be used in the treatment and  management of the diabetic population in the Region IV schools. The insulin  dosing chart was included in the packet to ensure proper insulin  administration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The task force partnered with the Region IV school  nurses, and the revised school packet was sent to Lisa Blackmon, MS, RN, Nurse  Specialist, Health and Medical Services, Houston Independent School District  (HISD), Region IV Liaison. Blackmon represented school nurses in her region of  HISD. The task force collaborated with Blackmon by email and received suggested  modifications and the necessary approvals. With the school nurses&rsquo; partnership,  the task force was able to make the recommended changes and implement the  revised school packet.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>July 2015–August 2015</u><br>
  Previously, the initiation and maintenance of the school  packet had been done using hard copies. The patient and family would receive  the school packet at the Diabetes and Endocrine Care Clinic and would then be  responsible for providing it to the school nurse. It was not, however, always  given to the school nurse, thus impeding the nurse&rsquo;s ability to treat and  manage the care of the diabetic patient in the school. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The difficulty in receiving the school packets from  students and families was identified through the partnership with the school  nurses. To ensure the school nurses receive the packet, and to make it more  accessible to all providers (inpatient and outpatient) caring for the diabetic patient,  the task force proposed that the school packet be created in the electronic  health record (EHR). The packet could then be transmitted directly to the  school nurse rather than relying on the patient/family to provide a hard copy  to the school. The task force also determined that incorporating the packet into  the EHR would provide a consistent way to make necessary updates throughout the  year.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ashley Dikes, MSN, RN, System Analyst, EPIC  Information Services, was  tasked with creating the electronic copy of the school packet to be  incorporated into the patient&rsquo;s EHR. The task force reviewed the electronic  copy for accuracy and ease of use, and Dikes collaborated with EPIC to  incorporate it into the EHR.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>September  2015</u><strong> </strong><br>
  In September 2015, the task force, with the  partnership of school nurses, identified the need for education on the school packet for  Region IV school nurses. The task force created educational materials to be  presented to approximately 100 school nurses at the Region IV school nursing  conference in September 2015. The multidisciplinary task force provided  education on the retrieval, content and use of the school packet. This open  forum allowed the Region IV school nurses to provide recommendations or necessary  modifications to the school packet, and they demonstrated their understanding  by practicing documenting in the school packet and calculating dosages of  insulin to administer.</p>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong><br>
  A  multidisciplinary team from the Diabetes and Endocrine Care Clinic partnered  with Region IV school nurses to improve overall outcomes for diabetic patients.  As a result of the partnership with Region IV school nurses, standardized  education was implemented through a revised school packet that was made accessible  to all providers, including school nurses caring for diabetic patients.  Following this, TCH saw a decrease in the rate of admissions of DKA patients to the Pulmonary Adolescent Endocrine Unit.  By improving the management and care of diabetic patients provided by school  nurses in the Region IV schools, the rate of admissions from within <span class="additional_docs_yellow">Region IV </span>DKA patients to  the Pulmonary Adolescent Endocrine Unit (14 WT) decreased from <span class="additional_docs_yellow">0.48</span> for January 2015–March  2015 to<span class="additional_docs_yellow"> 0.44</span> for  October 2015–December 2015,<span class="additional_docs_yellow"> 0.42</span> for January 2016–March 2016 and <span class="additional_docs_yellow">0.38</span> for April 2016–June 2016. </p>
