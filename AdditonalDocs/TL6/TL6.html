<h3>Example Three: Mentoring Activities for Ketrese White – Nurse  Leader</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <span class="additional_docs_yellow">Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital&rsquo;s (TCH) Chief  Nursing Officer Mary Jo Andre, MSN, RN, NEA-BC, recognizes the importance of developing  nursing leaders internally through mentoring activities to be successful in  their new nurse leadership role and to fill key leadership positions within TCH  when expected or unexpected departures occur. Andre invests in nurse leaders and provides exposure  and networking for continued growth. </p>
  </span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ketrese  White, MHA, RN, NE-BC, Director of Patient Care Services, began her career at  TCH more than 17 years ago as a  staff nurse in the Cancer/Hematology Centers on the Bone Marrow Transplant  (BMT) unit, where she also performed charge nurse and preceptor roles. White  moved into nurse leadership positions (nurse educator, then nurse manager)  while on the BMT unit. In 2010, White advanced to Assistant Director of  Inpatient Services, Child Life, and the Cancer and Hematology clinic &amp;  Infusion Center at TCH West Campus, where she exhibited great leadership  in the opening of the first community-based dedicated pediatric hospital in the  Houston area. White defined the patient experience process, assisted in the  development of strategies and business plans, established recruitment and hiring  practices, staffing and training plans while at West Campus. <A href="../../Home/page_unavailable.html">(Evidence TL6-12, Nurse Leader Ketrese White Resume)</A><a href="../Evidence/TL6c-11.pdf"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015,  TCH began its newest expansion of Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital - The Woodlands,  which is north of Houston. Michelle Riley-Brown, FACHE, President for Texas  Children&rsquo;s Hospital - The Woodlands, recognized White&rsquo;s leadership potential.  In June 2015, as plans for the expansion were underway, White was named  Director of Nursing for Patient Care Services TCH&nbsp;- The Woodlands.<span class="additional_docs_yellow"> In collaboration with  Riley-Brown, Andre identified ongoing mentoring activities for White which  included:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Attending the Nursing Leadership  Institute (NLI)</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Leading The Woodlands Campus Patient  Care Services Activation Team </li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Completion of the Leader Performance  Continuum Courses</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Providing organization exposure through  leadership meetings and forums</li>
  </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow"><strong>Ketrese  White – Mentoring Activities</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Nursing  Leadership Institute</em></strong><br>
  The  Nursing Leadership Institute (NLI) is an intensive program that provides  mentoring activities or succession planning for nurse leaders. It was developed  in 2014 by executives and Board members from the Texas Medical Center and many  other hospitals in the same geographical area to provide development  opportunities for career advancement. Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital (TCH) is one of  the many organizations that participate. There is an annual selection process  for participants, who must be recommended by a chief nursing officer. The  target audience includes CNOs, aspiring CNOs, nurse leaders identified for mentorship  or succession planning, and nursing faculty and leadership. The NLI gives  participants an opportunity to develop leadership skills while networking with  other nursing leaders from around the community. <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NLI  course topics include personal leadership development; organizational values,  assessment and governance; quality measurement and improvement strategies; financial and business management;  strategic planning and implementation; personnel leadership and management;  managing large groups; community health, community engagement, and population  health management; and innovation and information technology. Meetings for this  96-hour, multiple-session course are held monthly on a Thursday and Friday from  8 a.m. to 4 p.m. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>White&rsquo;s classes began on January 28, 2016. The  NLI topics and agenda for each class were as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>1/28/16 – Personal Leadership Development </li>
  <li>1/29/16 – Organizational Values, Assessment  and Governance</li>
  <li>2/11/16 – Strategic Planning and  Implementation</li>
  <li>2/12/16 – Quality Measurement and Improvement  Strategies (Clinical and Customer Experience)</li>
  <li>3/31/16 – Healthcare Environment: Reform and  Its Impact on the Nursing Workforce</li>

  <li>4/29/16 – Personnel Leadership and Management</li>
  <li>5/12/16 – Personnel Leadership and Management</li>
  <li>5/13/16 – Project Presentation and Graduation</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>White  graduated from the NLI, and the tools that she gained will continue to help her  be successful in her leadership journey. White also developed professional  relationships that will last throughout her career. She said it was an honor to  be selected into the prestigious NLI, and that the entire experience made a  positive impact on her growth and career. <a href="../Evidence/TL6c-a.pdf" class="additional_docs_yellow">(Evidence TL6c-a, Nurse Leadership Institute Overview, Ketrese  White Nurse Leadership Institute Class Agendas and Certificate from Nurse  Leadership Institute)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow"><strong><em>Leading The Woodlands Campus Patient  Care Services Activation Team </em></strong><br>
  Andre recognized a mentoring activity  for White to lead the The Woodlands Campus Patient Care Services Activation  Team activation planning team.  Beginning  2016, White spearheaded The Woodlands Campus Patient Care Services Activation  Team, which consisted of inter-professional team members from nursing, pharmacy,  respiratory care, quality/infection control, human resources, radiology, risk  management, compliance, biomedical engineering, information services,  facilities operations, clinical nutrition services, and security. White developed  The Woodlands Campus Patient Care Services Activation Team charter and the  project plan in preparation for operations and patient care services with the  opening of The Woodlands. The project plan for The Woodlands Campus Patient  Care Services Activation Team included:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Staffing – identification, review, and  modification of current staffing tools and proposed staffing plans</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Scope of Practice – identification,  modification, and approval of scope of care</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Policies and Procedures –  identification and modification of applicable policies and procedures based  upon The Woodlands operations</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Workflows and Operations –  identification of current best practices for implementation and modification of  select processes to meet the needs of the ideal patient experience at The  Woodlands</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Supplies, Equipment, and Forms –  identification and modification of necessary supplies, equipment, and forms  that will support The Woodlands operations</li>
  <li class="additional_docs_yellow">Mock Drills/Simulation – participation  in mock drills to ensure adequate preparation prior to opening of The Woodlands</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow">As the chair of The Woodlands Campus  Patient Care Services Activation Team, White held bi-weekly to monthly meetings.  With her direction, Lindi Stegeman, BSN, RN, CPEN, Kimberly Holt, BSN, RN, CPN,  Susan Romero, MSN, RN, NE-BC, and Juanna Brandon, MBA, BSN, NE-BC, the co-chairs  and members of The Woodlands leadership, facilitated some of The Woodlands  Campus Patient Care Services Activation Team meetings.  On February 10, 2016, White reviewed TCH - The  Woodlands Patient Care Services Activation Team Charter, team structure,  project plan, expectations, and deliverables with The Woodlands Campus Patient  Care Services Activation Team. At the meeting on February 24, 2016, White  gained agreement from The Woodlands Campus Patient Care Services Activation  Team on TCH - The Woodlands Patient Care Services Activation Team Charter,  discussed staffing tools and the orientation timelines. From March 2016 to September  2016, White led The Woodlands Campus Patient Care Services Activation Team with  drafting, revising, and finalizing staffing, scope of practice, policies and  procedures, workflows and operations, supplies, equipment, necessary forms. The  Woodlands Campus Patient Care Services Activation Team initiated training and  testing through simulation in September 2016 for outpatient and March 2017 for  inpatient. White&rsquo;s leadership with The Woodlands Campus Patient Care Services  Activation Team, led to the successful opening of the Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital  - The Woodlands outpatient clinics in October 2016, and the inpatient services in  April 2017. <a href="../Evidence/TL6c-b.pdf">(Evidence TL6c-b, The Woodlands Campus Patient Care  Services Activation Team Charter, Meeting Minutes, Meeting Agenda)</a></p>

  </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="additional_docs_yellow"><strong><em>Organization Exposure through  Leadership Meetings and Forums</em></strong><br>
  With Andre&rsquo;s direction, on April 4,  2016 Janet Austin, Senior Administrative Assistant for Andre, sent White an  email to inform her that she was on the agenda at the upcoming Nursing  Coordinating Council (NCC) meeting which is comprised of the chief nurse officer,  nurse leaders, and the clinical nurse chair and chair-elect of each council in the shared governance model. Andre determined  this as an opportunity for White to continue to develop skills set, presence,  and recognition. White presented The Woodlands project update to the NCC on April 26, 2016 and received verbal recognition  from Andre, nurse executives, and nurse leaders. On April 28, 2016, Riley-Brown  notified White of the opportunity to present The Woodlands planning update at  the Systems Leadership Forum that includes the chief executive officer,  executive vice presidents, and physician-in chiefs. White presented the vision  and structure of The Woodlands at the Texas Children&rsquo;s System Leadership Forum  in July 2016. Riley-Brown, chief executive officer, and the senior executives  provided positive feedback with White&rsquo;s engagement and presentation. Andre  recognized other opportunities for White to develop in her leadership role. In  May 2016 and September 2016, Andre informed Jody Childs, MBA, BSN, RN, Senior  Project Manager, to send an email requesting White to be on the panel to speak  about the planning and progress as she prepares for The Woodlands opening at  the town hall meeting in June 2016 and December 2016. At the June 2016 and  December 2016 town hall meeting, White provided project plan updates for The Woodlands  Campus Patient Care Services Activation Team, shared a video of the progress  made, and The Woodlands projected growth with clinical nurses, nurse managers,  nurse leaders including nurse executives, chief nurse officer, and other inter-professional  teams from across the organization. <a href="../Evidence/TL6c-d.pdf">(Evidence TL6c-d, NCC - Email &amp; Meeting Minutes,  Systems Leadership Forum - Email, Meeting Minutes, Recognition Email, Town Hall  - Email and White Presentations)</a></p>
